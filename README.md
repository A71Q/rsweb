Responsive Static Web
=====================

The plan is to develop a sample static responsive web page.


Used

1. HTML5 and CSS3.

2. html5doctor.com Reset Stylesheet

If we change the size of the view port it will show the content optimized for that view port.
Like instead of using 70% of the space it will use 95% of the space. Side by side design will
move to vertical design.
